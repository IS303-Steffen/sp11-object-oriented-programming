OPTIONAL AI GUIDANCE PROMPT
---------------------------
I am a student in an introductory Python class. I am learning many coding
principles for the very first time. I am going to paste in the instructions
to a practice problem that my professor gave me to try before class.
Please be my kind tutor and walk me through how to solve the problem step
by step.

Don't just give me the full solution all at once (unless I later ask for
it). Instead, help me work through it gradually, with clear explanations
and small, easy-to-understand examples. Please use everyday language and
explain things in a simple, friendly way.

INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------
1. Write a BankAccount class with an initial balance set in __init__.
2. Add deposit(self, amount) and withdraw(self, amount) methods.
   - deposit adds amount to balance.
   - withdraw subtracts amount if enough funds exist; otherwise prints
     "Insufficient funds".
3. Create an account with $100, deposit $50, withdraw $30, then attempt
   to withdraw $150. Print the balance after each action.
